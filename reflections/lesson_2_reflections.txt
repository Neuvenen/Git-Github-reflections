What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates meta data for this repository & make itself ready for further work.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It allows to investigate changes to be included in the commit. You may not wish to commit all changes at once but to separate them.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can check using git diff & git diff --staged commands if only changes belonging to one logical unit are prepared to be commited.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Creating some experimental features, major architectural changes.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They help me to see how far I diverged from main branch, as well as what's already commited on different branches.
