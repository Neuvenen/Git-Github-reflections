When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Basically always if I have acces to private & public repos. With privates I can work on something I don't want to share. This way I have always backup of my files on server. Same with public ones. For both types however it makes easier working with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because there may had occured some conflicts in the way when you did not pushed your changes but someone else did. This way you also have more control.
